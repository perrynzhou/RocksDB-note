### Contributing to PebblesDB
-----
Are you an undergraduate student looking to contribute to an interesting systems research project?

We could always use extra help in maintaining and extending PebblesDB! 

List of features we would like added:

1. Extending PebblesDB to use SURF filters (https://github.com/efficient/SuRF)
2. Allowing PebblesDB to run with a limited amount of memory (currently it uses all memory available)
3. Implementing the ideas behind Monkey in PebblesDB (https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/monkeykeyvaluestore.pdf)

If you are interested in implementing any of the above, please email vijay@cs.utexas.edu
